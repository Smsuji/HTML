developer.mozilla.org->to learn javascript well(one of the best site). 

Javascript: Java and javascript is entirely different
Javascript is named as ECMAScript earlier
It is a scripting language.
Scripting language has interpreter(line by line translation) only
All major web browsers have a dedicated javascript engine to execute the code on users devices.
Javascript OOP language--> yes
only OOP language --> no.
Javascript has 5 datatype.
Usage of javascript-> action
<script> tag->we can give in head as well as body. Giving in head tag is advisable.
To denote string- use " " or ' '.
var- means variable.(also called as identifier or reference variable)
It is not necessary to explicitly define var.
There is no semicolon in javascript syntax
=  -> assignment 
==  -> comparator

5 primitive(or basic) datatypes in javascript:
1)Number (operations like + - * / % **)
2)String (sequence of characters)
3)boolean (yes or no)


var name = 'suji'
var age = 25
var indian = true

typeof name-->string
typeof age-->number
typeof indian-->boolean


Methods: Set of instructions for performing a specific task.
prompt()
alert()
console.log()



ctrl+shift+j ->browser console will open-available in developer tool

Basic program:

index.html
----------
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>

demo.js:
-------
var name=prompt("Enter your name")
var age=prompt("Enter your age")
agedays = age * 365.25
alert('Hi ' + name + ' You have been in this world for ' + agedays+ ' Enjoy Happy Days ')

Javascript has 3 statements:

>Normal statement -> var name = 'suji'
>Conditional statement -> boolean true / false
For example:
var number = prompt("enter any no")
if(no%2 == 0)
 {
    console.log("Even no")
 }
else
{
   console.log("Odd no")
}
